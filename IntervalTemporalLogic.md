# Interval Temporal Logic: A Detailed Analysis Report for Signal Temporal Logic Experts

## Executive Summary

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of **Interval Temporal Logic (ITL)** for experts familiar with **Signal Temporal Logic (STL)**. ITL fundamentally differs from point-based temporal logics like STL by treating the basic unit of time as a "period" or "interval" rather than a single point. This paradigm shift gives ITL a unique ability to describe events, actions, and their complex interactions more naturally and expressively than STL's signal-based model.

This analysis focuses on the formal syntax and semantics of ITL, particularly its central **chop operator**, which allows for the decomposition of complex temporal behaviors into simpler components, enabling the modeling of both sequential and parallel compositions. The report also provides a direct comparison of ITL with other point-based temporal logics, especially STL, highlighting their respective strengths and ideal application domains. ITL has found applications in diverse fields, from formal verification of hardware to AI planning and natural language semantics, due to its superiority in specifying properties over temporal durations. In conclusion, ITL is not merely a historical artifact but a significant formal system with an active research community and a growing body of tools for analyzing and verifying complex temporal behaviors within systems.

# Chapter 1: The Fundamental Shift from Points to Intervals

## 1.1 Bridging the Gap from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to Interval Temporal Logic (ITL)

Temporal logic models time in different ways, affecting expressive power and application scope. STL models time as continuous real-valued signals, ideal for specifying requirements in cyber-physical systems (CPS) with quantitative semantics. ITL, in contrast, uses **intervals**—periods or stretches of time—allowing properties to span multiple states and enabling both sequential and parallel compositions. This interval-based approach supports propositional and first-order reasoning about time periods in hardware and software systems.

## 1.2 Philosophical and Formal Foundations of Interval Logic

Interval-based logic reflects a deeper understanding of temporal phenomena. In Halpern and Shoham's interval temporal logic (HS), point-based logics describe evolution "state-by-state," while interval-based logics express properties over stretches of states. The **homogeneity assumption** states that a proposition holds over an interval only if it holds over every state within that interval. ITL also models non-homogeneous properties, such as events that occur over intervals but not necessarily over sub-intervals.

ITL's roots trace back to Aristotle, Diodorus Cronus, and Arthur Prior's "Tense Logic." Ben Moszkowski's 1980s Stanford PhD thesis marked a milestone in interval-based reasoning for formal verification.

# Chapter 2: The Formal System of Interval Temporal Logic

## 2.1 Defining the Core Syntax and Semantics

ITL distinguishes between **state variables** (change over time) and **static variables** (invariant within an interval). Main syntactic categories:

- **Integer Expressions (ie):** `z`, `A`, `ig`, `◦A`, `fin A`
- **Boolean Expressions (be):** `b`, `Q`, `bg`, `◦Q`, `fin Q`
- **Formulas (f):** `true`, `h(e1,...)`, `¬f`, `f1 ∧ f2`, `∀V • f`, `skip`, `f1 ; f2` (chop), `f*` (chop-star)

### Common ITL Operators

| Operator      | Syntax      | Informal Semantics | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|-------|
| Chop         | $f_1 ; f_2$ | Interval can be split into prefix (where $f_1$ holds) and suffix (where $f_2$ holds) | Sequential composition |
| Chop-Star    | $f^*$       | Interval can be split into intervals where $f$ holds | Loops/iteration |
| Skip         | `skip`      | Unit interval of length 1 | Single state |
| Next         | $◦f$        | $f$ holds in the next state | Strong next |
| Final        | `fin A`     | Value of A in last state (if interval is finite) |  |
| Sometimes    | $∃f$        | $true ; f$ | Holds at some point |
| Always       | $∀f$        | $¬∃¬f$ | Holds throughout interval |
| Some initial | $∃_if$      | $f ; true$ | Holds in some initial subinterval |
| All subintervals | $∀_af$  | $¬∃_a¬f$ | Holds in all subintervals |

## 2.2 The Power of the "Chop" Operator ($f_1 ; f_2$)

The **chop operator** splits an interval into two parts: $f_1 ; f_2$ is true if the interval can be decomposed into a prefix where $f_1$ holds and a suffix where $f_2$ holds. This enables sequential composition and is the source of ITL's expressive power. Many imperative programming constructs can be modeled as ITL formulas.

## 2.3 Derived Temporal Constructs and Their Utility

By combining ITL operators, one can describe rich temporal properties, such as "something happens in some subinterval" or "always holds in all subintervals." ITL's ability to handle sequential and parallel compositions makes it ideal for distributed and concurrent systems.

## 3.1 ITL vs. STL: A Direct Comparison

| Feature                | Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) | Signal Temporal Logic (STL) |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Temporal Primitive     | Periods of time (intervals)   | Points in time, signals     |
| Time Domain            | Finite/infinite sequence      | Continuous signals          |
| Application Domains    | Hardware/software, AI planning| CPS, robotics, e-commerce   |
| Core Strengths         | Sequential/parallel composition, events | Quantitative robustness, continuous analysis |
| Key Operators          | Chop ($f_1 ; f_2$)            | Globally (G), Finally (F), Until (U) |

ITL excels at composing sequential behaviors and complex events, while STL is suited for continuous-valued behaviors and quantitative analysis in CPS.

## 3.2 Interval Logic vs. Point-Based Logics

- **Trace-based semantics:** Equivalent to LTL, but exponentially more succinct.
- **Computation-tree-based semantics:** Equivalent to finitary CTL*.
- **State-based semantics:** Incomparable with LTL, CTL, and CTL*.

Interval-based logics offer a different modeling choice, especially for properties involving events or durations.

## 3.3 Variations and Extensions of Interval Logic

**Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL)** is a fragment of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) designed for decidability. MITL expresses interval-based statements (e.g., "P held between 9 and 10 time units ago") rather than precise points ("P held exactly ten time units ago"). This bounded variability makes model checking decidable.

## 4.1 Formal Verification of Hardware and Software

ITL has played a significant role in verifying hardware protocols and real-time systems. Its executable subset, **Tempura**, is widely used for specifying properties of real-time systems and scientific applications.

## 4.2 AI, Planning, and Natural Language Semantics

ITL's interval-based model is highly expressive for representing actions and events in AI and natural language semantics. It models:

- Concurrency and interaction

ITL distinguishes between states, ongoing activities, and events in natural language semantics.

# Conclusion and Outlook

ITL is a powerful alternative to point-based logics like STL. Its interval-based paradigm enables expressive modeling of events, actions, and their composition. The chop operator is central to ITL's power. ITL is exponentially more succinct than point-based logics for certain properties, and fragments like MITL address decidability. Supported by tools like Tempura and Isabelle/HOL, ITL remains relevant for verification, AI, and scientific domains. Future research may explore hybrid logics combining ITL's compositionality with STL's quantitative strengths.
